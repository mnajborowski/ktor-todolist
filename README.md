## Introduction
Welcome to `ktor-todolist`, a prototype application built with Ktor framework created as part of my Master Thesis - *API security built with Ktor framework and GraphQL query language*. The thesis has been submitted in support of candidature for a master degree of IT studies in cybersecurity specialty at Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ. 

The goal of the project is to show how to implement every type of authentication supported by Ktor and use it to secure a REST or GraphQL API, as well as to present some of the good practices, missing in the official Ktor documentation. Also, as part of the project, a custom, easy to use and extend authorization mechanism has been created and used in both APIs. The latter is especially important, as Ktor misses a native authorization mechanizm.

## Most important files:
- common:
  - [Authorization.kt](src/main/kotlin/com/example/common/plugins/authorization/Authorization.kt) - class containing generic authorization mechanism, customised by separate functions like the one in [RoleBasedAuthorization.kt](src/main/kotlin/com/example/common/plugins/authorization/RoleBasedAuthorization.kt) or [AttributeBasedAuthorization.kt](src/main/kotlin/com/example/common/plugins/authorization/AttributeBasedAuthorization.kt), which main purpose is to pass a custom lambda expression with authorization checks
  - [Security.kt](src/main/kotlin/com/example/common/plugins/Security.kt) - configurations for each type of authentication supported by Ktor
  - [AuthorizationRouting.kt](src/main/kotlin/com/example/common/plugins/authorization/AuthorizationRouting.kt) - REST API routing configuration, containing endpoint handlers for different types of login
  - [GraphQL.kt](src/main/kotlin/com/example/common/plugins/GraphQL.kt) - GraphQL API routing configuration, containing endpoint handlers for getting and creating a user
- user:
  - [UserRouting.kt](src/main/kotlin/com/example/user/api/UserRouting.kt) - REST API routing configuration, containing endpoint handlers for user CRUD actions

## How to run the application
The application requires a PostgreSQL database running on JDBC URL `jdbc:postgresql://localhost/postgres` on 5432 port with user `michal.najborowski` and no password. It can be either ran as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) or, if on a MacOS computer system, as a local database set by a [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com) application.
It is built with [Gradle Build Tool](https://gradle.org/install/) version at least 7.1 or higher, which also requires [JavaJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net) version at least 1.8 or higher.

With prerequisities correctly set up, the application is built with command
```
gradle build
```
and ran with command
```
gradle run
```

The basic path is `localhost:8080`. The GraphQL sandbox is available under `/graphql` GET request. All request are available as a [Postman](https://www.postman.com) collection in the [resources/postman](src/main/resources/postman) directory and can be executed with this tool aswell.
